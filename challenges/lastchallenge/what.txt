There are two files in there that we can both use to try and change to see which one can be working

  vic.py: error where the yetiborg package isn't installed so it's not used
          - possible solutions: installing yetiborg package OR using zeroborg package drive and turn function
          - use driving functions that are in the myrace.py file
